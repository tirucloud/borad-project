# BoardgameListingWebApp

## Description

**Board Game Database Full-Stack Web Application.**
This web application displays lists of board games and their reviews. While anyone can view the board game lists and reviews, they are required to log in to add/ edit the board games and their reviews. The 'users' have the authority to add board games to the list and add reviews, and the 'managers' have the authority to edit/ delete the reviews on top of the authorities of users.
